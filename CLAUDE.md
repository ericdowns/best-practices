# CLAUDE.md - Instructions for Claude Code

This repository contains modular best practice files for WordPress theme development. When working with these files, please follow these guidelines:

## Reading Best Practices

- Each `.md` file contains a complete, self-contained best practice
- Read the entire file to understand the pattern before implementing
- Pay attention to the "Do's and Don'ts" sections
- Use the code examples as templates, not exact copies

## Implementation Guidelines

When asked to implement a best practice:

1. **Read the specific file** mentioned (e.g., `tailwind-images.md`)
2. **Adapt the patterns** to the current project's needs
3. **Follow the conventions** documented in the file
4. **Use the code structure** but adjust content/classes for the specific use case
5. **Reference the file** if you need clarification on the pattern

## File Structure

- `README.md` - General overview and index of practices
- `[technology]-[topic].md` - Individual best practice files
- Each file is **project-agnostic** and contains reusable patterns

## Common Usage Patterns

The user may say things like:
- "Use the image pattern from tailwind-images.md"
- "Implement the pb-bottom method from the best practices repo"  
- "Follow the image handling best practice"

In these cases:
1. Read the referenced file
2. Apply the documented pattern
3. Adapt it to the current project context

## Key Points

- **Never reference specific project names** from these files
- **Always adapt patterns** to the current project's naming/structure
- **Follow the documented conventions** exactly as specified
- **Ask for clarification** if a pattern doesn't fit the current use case

These files are meant to be quick reference guides that can be shared via GitHub links during active development.
